## FALL BUCKET LIST 2025

<img src="/pictures/fall2025.jpg"/>

Fall used to be the first days of school\
Which I miss more now than I ever knew\
Red, orange, and yellow hues\
Colors I grew up around now give me the blues\
Reminding me of a time and place\
That I can never replace\
Or go back to\
Since it's already been lived through
