## my radish success story

I grew a variety of vegetables this year and hope to become a more legitimate farmer in the future. Through my experience growing plants in containers on my roof, I have developed a deep admiration and interest in those who can grow their food in mass, aka farmers. In this post, I will share my radish success story. 

# Last year - August 2024

My urge to plant vegetables emerged unprompted last year. I'm not sure why but after I purchased my beloved car, Anastasia, my first stop was Home Depot. I entered Home Depot with unusual clarity and left with a jalapeno and heirloom tomato plant. In this photo, you will see my love for the jalapeno plant as well as my bountiful yield.

# March 2025

Fast forward to this year, when March struck, I knew I had to act fast. My initial instincts led me to buy kale, carrot, and flower seeds. However, a trip to Swanson's, a local nursery with everything you could imagine a gardener needing, inspired me to invest in radish seeds. One of the employees there advocated for it and filled me with radish-related dreams and passion. I bought and sowed the seeds once I returned home.

# May 2nd

I experienced the ultimate joy Friday evening when I spontaneously bolted to the roof and yanked out 7 gorgeous and bulbous radishes. This was the high of my life. I dream of growing and pulling out many more radishes in my lifetime.

# May 3rd

I ate 4 radishes today.

Pictured here is a citrus and radish salad constructed by Sam and I. Thinnly sliced radishes, avocado, and pistachos sit atop a bed of butter lettuce, radish greens, and mint.

# Conclusion

I have never appreciated and respected radishes so much. I appreciate them because they gave me an incredible beginners gardening experience since they are so easy to grow. I respect them because they work so hard to grow so fast and be so high quality and crunchy.
