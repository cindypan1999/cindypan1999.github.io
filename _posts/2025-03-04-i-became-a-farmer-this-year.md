## I Became A Farmer This Year

I became a farmer this year. That said, my yield is not impressive, so I don't mean disrespect to farmers in anyway by calling myself a farmer. If anything, I have deep admiration and interest and those who can grow their food in mass. In this post, I will share my radish success story. 

# Last year - August 2024

My urge to plant vegetables emerged unprompted last year. I'm not sure the reason but after I purchased my beloved car, Anastasia, my first stop was Home Depot. I entered Home Depot with unusual clarity and left with a jalapeno and heirloom tomato plant. In this photo you will see my love for the jalapeno plant as well as my bountiful yield.

# March 2025

Fast forward to this year, when March struck, I knew I had to act fast. My initial endeavors actually led me to buy kale, carrot, and flower seeds. More on that later. However, I trip to Swanson's, a local nursery with everything you could imagine a gardener needing, inspired me to invest in radish seeds. One of the employees there advocated for it and filled me with dreams and passion. I bought and sowed the seeds once I returned home.
