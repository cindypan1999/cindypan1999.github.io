## SUMMER BUCKET LIST 2025

<img src="/pictures/summer2025.jpg"/>

I think Seattle is the most beautiful place on Earth during all times of the year but especially during the summer. After nine months of gloom and drizzle, the clouds fade away to reward us with three months of clear blue skies and days with fifteen hours of light. Even on the most mundane of days, you can't escape the lush greenery, flowers you've never seen before, and Mt. Rainier hovering in the backdrop of it all. After four years of living here, I know it'll never get old. So each summer, my main goal is to make sure I stay in Seattle and make the most of it. Here's what I plan to do: 

- [ ] Camp in a lookout tower
- [x] Bike around bainbridge
- [ ] Do one 10 mile run
- [ ] See a drive-in movie
- [ ] See The Weeknd in concert
- [ ] Play volleyball
- [ ] Go to Silverwood Theme Park
- [ ] Do karaoke
- [ ] Skinny dip
- [ ] Do a triathalon
- [ ] See Lady Gaga live
- [ ] Buy a bike
- [ ] Take pictures with my camera
- [ ] Weekend trip to Mt. Hood
