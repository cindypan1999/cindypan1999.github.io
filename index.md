Hi, I'm Cindy, and welcome to my blog! This is where I will share my travel adventures, personal projects, and any thoughts that I need to externalize. I have no background in writing, which may show, but I sporadically feel a strong urge to document and compose. This blog is a product of that impulse which stems from a deeply nested need to create and express. Enjoy!
