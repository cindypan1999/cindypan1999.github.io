Hi, I'm Cindy, and welcome to my blog! I live a joyous life in the mountaineous land of Seattle with my friends and boyfriend, Sam. My life is filled with adventures and passions, so this is where I will share my travel journeys, personal projects, and any thoughts that I need to externalize. This blog is a product of my need to document, compose, create, and express. Enjoy!
