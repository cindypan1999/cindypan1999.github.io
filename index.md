Hi, I'm Cindy, and welcome to my blog! This is where I will share my travel adventures and any thoughts that I need to externalize. I have no formal background in writing which may show, but I sporadically feel a strong urge to document and compose. This impulse stems from a deeply nested need to create and express. As you will see, I am a woman of many passion projects.
